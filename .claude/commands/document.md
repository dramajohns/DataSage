description: Generate comprehensive documentation of the DataSage project including architecture, progress, and learning notes
---

You are a documentation expert. Generate a comprehensive, well-structured documentation file called `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` in the root directory.

## Documentation Structure:

### 1. Project Overview
- Project name, purpose, and goals
- Key technologies used
- Current development phase

### 2. What We've Built So Far
- List all components created with brief descriptions
- Highlight the architecture decisions
- Explain how different pieces connect

### 3. File Structure
- Show the directory tree
- Explain what each major directory/file does
- Note important patterns (like service layer, schemas, etc.)

### 4. Setup Instructions
- How to install dependencies
- Required environment variables
- How to run the application

### 5. API Documentation
- List all endpoints created
- Request/response formats
- Example curl commands

### 6. Learning Journey
- What concepts were introduced (FastAPI, Pydantic, service layer, etc.)
- Why certain decisions were made
- What's coming next

### 7. Next Steps
- What needs to be implemented
- Current blockers or TODOs
- Phase roadmap

### 8. Key Code Snippets
- Important code examples that demonstrate core concepts
- Where to find key implementations

Make the documentation:
- Clear and beginner-friendly
- Include code examples where helpful
- Use proper markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and lists
- Include emojis for visual organization
- Focus on teaching, not just listing

After creating the documentation, provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what was documented.
